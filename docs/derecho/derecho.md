Just proof of concept for https://arc.ucar.edu/knowledge_base/74317833

Derecho, the new supercomputer NCAR installed in 2023, features 2,488 compute nodes with 128 AMD Milan cores per node and 82 nodes with four NVIDIA A100 GPUs each. The HPE Cray EX cluster is a 19.87-petaflops system that is expected to deliver about 3.5 times the scientific throughput of the Cheyenne system. Additional hardware details are available below.

See the following pages for user documentation that is relevant to all NCAR systems (compiling code, environment module basics, managing allocations), and the menu on the right of your screen for system-specific information.

Additional Derecho documentation is in development. 

NOTE: Derecho users can expect to see a 1.3x improvement over the Cheyenne system's performance on a core-for-core basis. Therefore, to estimate how many CPU core-hours will be needed for a project on Derecho, multiply the total for a Cheyenne project by 0.77.

When requesting an allocation for Derecho GPU nodes, please make your request in terms of GPU-hours (number of GPUs used x wallclock hours). We encourage researchers to estimate GPU-hour needs by making test/benchmark runs on Casper GPUs, but will accept estimates based on runs on comparable non-NCAR, GPU-based systems.
